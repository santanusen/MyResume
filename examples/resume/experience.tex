    {Member Technical Staff} % Job title
    {NetApp India Pvt. Ltd.} % Organization
    {A Fortune 500 Hybrid Cloud Data Management Solutions Company} % Organization Description
    {Dec. 2018 - Present} % Date(s)
    {Bangalore, India} % Location
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Working on an Auto-Scaling solution to achieve reduction in cloud resource usage costs of NetApp's containerized Software Defined Data Management solution on Kubernetes orchestrated platforms.}
        \item {Wrote a Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) simulator to mimic resource recommendations and evictions of a VPA managed pod. The tool enabled simulation of several months of resource usage within seconds and helped fine tune the auto-scaling solution.}
        \item {Architected and implemented the liveness and readiness features for Data Management pods which helped in detection of multiple issues early in the development cycle.}
        \item {Optimized the RESTful API handler implementation for cluster-level space attributes retrieval to reduce API response timings from more than 5 seconds to less than a second.}
        \item {Designed and implemented a scheme for protection of system-critical memory pages in the Data Management binary from accidental writes.}
        \item {Designed and developed the software upgrade flow for the Data Management containers.}
      \end{cvitems}
    }

    {Staff Software Development Engineer} % Job title
    {Infinera India Pvt. Ltd.} % Organization
    {A Global Supplier of Innovative Networking Solutions; A Pioneer in Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits Design} % Organization Description
    {Jul. 2012 - Nov. 2018} % Date(s)
    {Bangalore, India} % Location
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {Enhanced the Network Element Transaction Framework through private workspaces for write transactions which achieved a superior scaling to support 15 simultaneous NMS connections compared to only 3 NMS connections by a 64 chassis Network Element cluster.}
      \item {Architected and implemented a Network Element Link Traversal Framework to simplify the fault correlation logic. The framework was later reused by multiple features which saw a reduction in the number of traversal related bugs from 2 per feature on average to 0.}
      \item {Designed and developed a declarative Fault Correlation and Management Framework for the Software Defined Networking suite which accomplished specification of new alarm definitions and fault correlation rules through external files without recompilation.}
      \item {Designed and developed a C++ Cryptographic Wrapper Library to simplify digital signature verification and decryption of Instant Bandwidth licenses. The library was later reused to implement several other security features.}
      \item {Designed the Management Layer object modelling of a number of Network Element modules, such as Optical Broadcasting Modules, Multiplexers, Muxponders and Protection Switching modules, across several releases.}
      \end{cvitems}
    }

    {Lead Engineer, R\&D} % Job title
    {Tejas Networks Ltd.} % Organization
    {A TL 9000 Certified Optical Networking Products Company} % Organization Description
    {Jun. 2006 - Jun. 2012} % Date(s)
    {Bangalore, India} % Location
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Enhanced the Network Element Software transaction performance by backgrounding and batching of configuration database commits which reduced centralized NMS based circuit restoration timings from 40 seconds to sub-second.}
        \item {Designed and implemented different Automatically Switched Optical Network service classes using Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching. Created a User Mode Linux based simulation framework which effected a drastic reduction in unit-testing time.}
	\item {Designed and developed a System Startup and Failover Manager with a state machine based phased initialization of Network Element Software.}
	\item {Improved management layer security of Network Elements through imlementing HTTPS support for the webserver, user session management, and audit logging of configuration changes.}
	\item {Simplified user-management across multiple Network Elements by implementing support for a centralized RADIUS based authentication. The feature relieved the operators from adding and managing users separately in each individual Network Element.}
      \end{cvitems}
