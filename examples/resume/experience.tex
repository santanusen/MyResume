    {Member Technical Staff} % Job title
    {NetApp} {India Pvt. Ltd.} % Organization
    {A Fortune 500 Hybrid Cloud Data Management Solutions Company} % Organization Description
    {Dec. 2018 - Present} % Date(s)
    {Bangalore, India} % Location
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Led the design of space management features of OntapX, NetApp's next generation disaggregated data management
		platform, and contributed to the implementation of automatic space rebalancing, space reservation management for
		guaranteed client operations and proactive space reclaimation through autodelete of old snapshots. }
        \item {Drove the design and delivery of Granular Data Distribution on NAS volumes. Ideated the architectures of efficient
		management of space guarantees, autoheal and lost data recovery for distributed files which were filed for
		patenting.}
        \item {Spearheaded the design and implementation of exporting the multipart file layout to pNFS clients.}
	\item {Replaced fixed space reservation for the inode metafile with dynamic allocations, achieving a 50\% reduction in
		space reserved for volume metadata and an 8-fold increase in the maximum number of files in a volume.}
        \item {Optimized the infrastructure for cluster-level space attributes retrieval using caching to reduce REST API
		response timings from more than 5 seconds to less than a second.}
	\item {Led the development efforts of containerization of Ontap data management components to offer a software defined
		cloud storage solution which later became the core of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Implemented the system startup,
		softwre upgrade, and liveness and readiness features for Data Management pods helping in detection of multiple
		issues early in the development cycle.}
        \item {Designed and implemented a scheme for protection of system-critical memory pages from accidental writes in the
		Data Management binary.}

    {Staff Software Development Engineer} % Job title
    {Infinera} {India Pvt. Ltd.} % Organization
    {A Global Supplier of Innovative Networking Solutions; A Pioneer in Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits Design} % Organization Description
    {Jul. 2012 - Nov. 2018} % Date(s)
    {Bangalore, India} % Location
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {Enhanced the Network Element Transaction Framework through private workspace for write transactions which achieved a superior scaling to support 15 simultaneous NMS connections compared to only 3 NMS connections by a 64 chassis Network Element cluster.}
      \item {Created a Network Element Link Traversal Framework to simplify the fault correlation logic. The framework, later patented, was reused by multiple features which saw a reduction in the number of traversal related bugs from 2 per feature on average to 0.}
      \item {Designed and developed a declarative Fault Correlation and Management Framework for the Software Defined Network suite. The framework accomplished specification of new alarm definitions and fault correlation rules without recompilation and was filed for a patent.}
      \item {Designed and developed a C++ Cryptographic Wrapper Library to simplify digital signature verification and decryption of Instant Bandwidth licenses. The library was later reused to implement several other security features.}
      \item {Contributed to engineering efforts from object modelling, to implementation and delivery of a number of Network Element Management Plane Software modules such as Optical Amplifiers, Broadcasting Modules, Multiplexers, Cross-Connects and Protection Switching modules across several releases.}
      \end{cvitems}

    {Lead Engineer, R\&D} % Job title
    {Tejas Networks} {Ltd.} % Organization
    {A TL 9000 Certified Optical Networking Products Company} % Organization Description
    {Jun. 2006 - Jun. 2012} % Date(s)
    {Bangalore, India} % Location
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Enhanced the Network Element Software transaction performance by backgrounding and batching of configuration database commits which reduced centralized NMS based circuit restoration timings from 40 seconds to sub-second. The work was recognized with an achievement award.}
        \item {Designed and implemented different Automatically Switched Optical Network service classes using Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching. Created a User Mode Linux based simulation framework which effected a drastic reduction in unit-testing time.}
	\item {Designed and developed a System Startup and Failover Manager supporting a state machine based phased initialization of Network Element Software.}
	\item {Improved management layer security of Network Elements through implementing HTTPS support for the web server, user session management, and audit logging of configuration changes.}
	\item {Simplified user-management across multiple Network Elements by implementing support for a centralized RADIUS based authentication. The feature relieved the operators from adding and managing users separately in each individual Network Element.}
